# Part-1 : System Design(ecommerce.js)

This project is a simplified e-commerce system that handles basic operations like user management, product catalog, order management, and payment processing. It is written in JavaScript using basic class structures to simulate a backend service.

## Features

- **Users**: Can create and manage orders.
- **Products**: Can be added to orders, each having its own price.
- **Orders**: Contain multiple products, with support for order status tracking.
- **Payments**: Associated with orders and can be marked as completed.

## Project Structure

The system is designed around four main classes:

1. **User**: Represents a user in the system who can create and view orders.
2. **Product**: Represents a product in the catalog with a price.
3. **Order**: Represents an order that a user places, which contains multiple products.
4. **Payment**: Represents payment for a specific order.

## Class Descriptions

### User Class

- **Properties**:
  - `userId`: Unique identifier for the user.
  - `name`: Name of the user.
  - `email`: Email of the user.
  - `orders`: Array to store the user's orders.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `addOrder(order)`: Adds a new order to the user's order list.
  - `getOrders()`: Retrieves all orders made by the user.

### Product Class

- **Properties**:
  - `productId`: Unique identifier for the product.
  - `name`: Name of the product.
  - `price`: Price of the product.

### Order Class

- **Properties**:
  - `orderId`: Unique identifier for the order.
  - `userId`: The user who made the order.
  - `status`: Status of the order (e.g., pending, completed, shipped).
  - `date`: The date when the order was placed.
  - `products`: Array to store the products added to the order.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `addProduct(product)`: Adds a product to the order.
  - `getTotalAmount()`: Calculates the total amount of the order.
  - `updateStatus(newStatus)`: Updates the status of the order.

### Payment Class

- **Properties**:
  - `paymentId`: Unique identifier for the payment.
  - `orderId`: The order associated with the payment.
  - `amount`: The amount of the payment.
  - `status`: Status of the payment (e.g., pending, completed).
  
- **Methods**:
  - `completePayment()`: Marks the payment as completed.

## Example Usage

The system simulates the interaction between users, orders, and payments. Hereâ€™s how you can use the system:

```javascript
// Create users
const user1 = new User(1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
const user2 = new User(2, 'Bob', 'bob@example.com');

// Create products
const product1 = new Product(101, 'Laptop', 1200);
const product2 = new Product(102, 'Mouse', 25);

// Create orders
const order1 = new Order(201, user1.userId);
order1.addProduct(product1);
order1.addProduct(product2);

// Add order to user1
user1.addOrder(order1);

// Create a payment for the order
const payment1 = new Payment(301, order1.orderId, order1.getTotalAmount());
payment1.completePayment();

console.log(user1);
console.log(payment1);

# Part-2 Business-Logic(business_logic.js)
# Inventory Management System

This project is an inventory management system designed to track stock levels and handle restocking of products in a warehouse. It processes sales orders, reduces stock levels accordingly, and triggers restock alerts when stock falls below a threshold.

## Features

- **Track Product Stock**: Keeps track of the available stock for each product.
- **Process Orders**: Processes incoming sales orders, reduces stock levels, and triggers alerts for products that fall below the threshold.
- **Restocking**: Allows for restocking items when necessary, updating stock levels.

## Business Logic

### Classes

- **Product**
  - Properties:
    - `productId`: Unique identifier for the product.
    - `name`: Name of the product.
    - `stock`: Current stock level of the product.
    - `threshold`: The minimum stock level before an alert is triggered (default is 10).
  - Methods:
    - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the product.

### Functions

- **`processOrders(products, orders)`**:
  - Takes a dictionary of products and a list of incoming sales orders.
  - Reduces stock levels for the products ordered.
  - Triggers an alert if any product's stock falls below the threshold.
  - Handles errors when there is insufficient stock for a product.
  
  **Parameters**:
  - `products`: Dictionary of `Product` objects (e.g., `{productId: Product}`).
  - `orders`: List of sales orders in the form of `[productId, quantity]`.

- **`restockItems(products, restockList)`**:
  - Takes a dictionary of products and a list of restock requests.
  - Updates the stock levels based on the required restocking quantities.
  
  **Parameters**:
  - `products`: Dictionary of `Product` objects.
  - `restockList`: List of restocking requests in the form of `[productId, quantity]`.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Initialize products
const products = {
  101: new Product(101, 'Laptop', 15),
  102: new Product(102, 'Mouse', 5),
  103: new Product(103, 'Keyboard', 20),
};

// Incoming sales orders: [productId, quantity]
const orders = [
  [101, 5], // 5 Laptops
  [102, 3], // 3 Mice
  [103, 25], // 25 Keyboards (exceeds available stock)
];

// Process orders
processOrders(products, orders);

// Restock items: [productId, quantity]
const restockList = [
  [102, 10], // Restock 10 Mice
  [103, 30], // Restock 30 Keyboards
];

// Restock products
restockItems(products, restockList);
